# Project Goals

The Project Goals Where As Follows -

Write a function that takes as its input a number (n) and converts it to a string, the contents of which depend on the numbers factors

- if the number has a factor of 3, output 'Pling'
- if the number has a factor of 5, output 'Plang'
- if the number has a factor of 7, output 'Plong'
- if the number does not have any of the above as a factor simply return the numbers digits

Create tests to provide as much coverage as many possible roots as possible

## Tools Used

**Tools** used for this project are 

- Nunit - a unit testing framework for all .NET languages with a strong TDD focus. Nunit was chosen because it is my favoured testing framework, along with the fact that I am accustomed  to Nunit more benefits  include its fast testing time which is a blessing for testers with multiple test and its is open source with very good support which works for this project

- Windows - Operating System developed and published by Microsoft. Although it is now cross platform .NET is originally made for windows.

- Visual Studio 2019 (Community) - is an *IDE* that has a creative launching pad that can be used to edit, debug, and build code.  favoured IDE for obvious reasons but some benefits include Windows-based programming tools, .NET go to developing instrument and VS is well structured, easy-to-use interface.

- Typora - favoured markdown editor / markdown reader. Personal favourite md reader / writer, it has a minimalist feel to it and is clear and concise.

- .Net 5.0 - a cross platform and open-source development platform.

# Program



# Tests

I have tried to follow the 5 characteristics of a good test

- **Fast**. 
- **Isolated**.
- **Repeatable**. 
- **Self-Checking**. 
- **Timely**. 

## Code coverage

The name of your test should consist of three parts:

- The name of the method being tested.
- The scenario under which it's being tested.
- The expected behavior when the scenario is invoked.



- Naming standards are important because they explicitly express the intent of the test.

Arrange 

Act 

Assert



### Avoid multiple asserts

When writing your tests, try to only include one Assert per test. Common approaches to using only one assert include:

- Create a separate test for each assert.
- Use parameterized tests.
